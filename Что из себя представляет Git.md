# Instruction how to work with Git and deleted repositories:


## What is  Git: 

**Git** - is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files,usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development its goals include speed,data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows(thousands of parallel branches running on different computes).

## How to create repositories: 
For the  creation of  repositories we should run the command ```Git init```  in the  repository folder and then you create Repository

## The creation of  commits

```sh
Git add "file"
```
 - is a start of  your commit,you need to let **Git** know what changes you'd like to include  

```shell
Git commit '--m "Some comment"'
```
Once you've saved and staged the changes,you're ready to make the commit

```shell
Git status
```
This command shows you what branch you're on,what files are in the working or staging directory,and any other  important information

```shell
Git log "--oneline"
``` 
browse and  inspect the evolution of project  files

```shell
Git checkout "branch-name" or "Master"
```
Switches to specified branch and updates the  working directory

```shell
Git diff
```
